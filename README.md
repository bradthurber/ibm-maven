Maven .pom files for IBM WebSphere Application Sever and IBM WebSphere Portal assets

My purpose for doing this is so that I have a complete set of container JAR files to build against for WAS and Portal. 

Some of these files are based on the .POM files provided by IBM here http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/maven/repository/com/ibm/tools/
